Framework:
A framework is a software. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.
 
Dot NET provides BCL and CLR
BCL-Base class Libraries-Base Class Libraries (BCL) is designed by Microsoft. Without BCL we canâ€™t write any code in .NET. So, BCL is also known as the basic building block of .NET Programs. 
These are installed into the machine when we installed the .NET framework. BCL contains pre-defined classes and these classes are used for the purpose of application development.
CLR-common language runtime-CLR stands for Common Language Runtime and it is the core component under the .NET framework 
which is responsible for converting the MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code.
JIT-it stands for the Just-in-Time compiler. It is the component of CLR that is responsible for converting MSIL code into Native Code.
